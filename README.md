## Mindful Harvest Web-Store

At Mindful Harvest, we belive in a world built slowly, with care, and compassion. The world we build around us should reflect who we are and how we live.
To create a more connected community that cares about one another, we provide the customer with home-made and organic products like clothing, jewelry, toys, home living, and art, including customisable products. We bring small businesses together and connect customers to local and sustainable products.
At our website, customers can make purchases and have them delivered to their home address. Customers can also make a profile so that the checkout process is easier, as their cart information will be saved for later use.

## Database Model

![Database Model](database_schema.JPG)

## Getting Started

1. Make a new repository using this template
2. Add your teammates as collaborators on the repository
3. Clone your repository locally
4. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
5. Setup your `.env` file locally - you can use the `.env.example` as a guideline. In particular, you will need to setup `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL` environment variables. But you may as well at a `JWT_SECRET` while you're in there.
6. Run `npm run dev` to run locally


### Starting the App

Start just the server (great while only working on API endpoints)
```
npm run server:dev
```

For starting the full-stack application - the server will restart whenever changes are made in the `server` directory, and the React app will rebuild whenever changes are made in the `client` directory.

```
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

This will run Jest with verbose output enabled:
```
npm run test
```

If you want Jest to continually run as files are changed, you can call:
```
npm run test -- --watch
```

Or if you want Jest to continually run all tests when files change:
```
npm run test -- --watchAll
```

### Seed the Database

This will run the `server/db/seed.js` file:
```
npm run seed
```

### Deploying the App

You will need to create a Database in your hosting provider of choice (Render or Heroku both work well, but only Render is free).

Once you have a Database URL setup, you will need to setup your Environment Variables to include your Database URL, as well as any other app secrets needed (eg. JWT secret, Client ID and Secret for OAuth, etc)

Whichever provider you use, you will need to set the following settings:

**Build Command:** `npm install && npm run seed && npm run build`
**Start Command:** `npm start`
